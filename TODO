- [ ] make script that prepares all gb, wals, distance data and make sure the 'drop col' stuff is not necessary anymore.
- [ ] clean up `evaluation` folder
- [ ] make sure `evaluation/experiments/*.csv` can be pushed (gitignore) once final experiment results are done!
- [ ] add proper instructions to readme + clean up readme
- [ ] check TODO comments in code
- [ ] deal with logical dependencies as a result of binarisation: weighting (?)
- [ ] add feature (group) inclusion / exclusion functionality
- [ ] downstream experiments (will be a lot)
- [ ] algorithm comparison: complexity, efficiency, accuracy (vs. brute force?)
- [x] implement typological evaluation (intrinsic) metrics
- [x] normalise distances
- [x] check if everything works
- [x] sort outputs
