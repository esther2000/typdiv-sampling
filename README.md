# A Principled Framework for Evaluating on Typologically Diverse Languages

![alt text](img/typdiv-overview.png)

> **Abstract:**
> Beyond individual languages, multilingual natural language processing (NLP) research increasingly aims to develop models that perform well across languages generally.
> However, evaluating these systems on all the world's languages is practically infeasible.
> Previous work argues that generalizable multilingual evaluation sets should contain languages with diverse typological properties.
> However, `typologically diverse' language samples have been found to vary considerably in this regard, and popular sampling methods are flawed and inconsistent.
> We present a language sampling framework for selecting highly typologically diverse languages given a sampling frame, informed by language typology.
> We compare sampling methods with a range of metrics and find that our systematic sampling method consistently retrieves more typologically diverse language selections than previous methods in NLP.
> Moreover, we provide evidence that this affects generalizability in multilingual model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of diverse language sampling in NLP evaluation.

# Example usage

### Sampling
```python
from typdiv_sampling import Sampler
from pathlib import Path

# A list of glottocodes to sample from.
frame = ['stan1293', 'russ1263', 'finn1318', 'nucl1301', 'stan1290', 'kore1280']
k = 3  # The number of languages to sample.
seed =  1 # A random seed for the non-deterministic methods.

# Initialize with default setup.
sampler = Sampler(
    dist_path=dist_path,  # Language distances to use.
    gb_path=gb_path,  # Grambank csv file.
    wals_path=wals_path,  # WALS csv file
    counts_path=counts_path,  # Convenience count file.
)
sampler.sample_mdp(frame, k)
> ['kore1280', 'russ1263', 'stan1290']
```
Sampling methods include: ```sample_mdp()``` (MaxSum), ```sample_mmdp()``` (MaxMin) and several baselines: ```sample_random()```, ```sample_convenience()```, ```sample_random_family()```, ```sample_random_genus()```.

An example of sampling usage in practice is found in: ```evaluation/experiment.py```.


### Typological diversity evaluation
```python
from typdiv_sampling.evaluation import Evaluator

evaluator = Evaluator(
                      gb_by_lang,  # Grambank feature vectors
                      dist_dict  # Pairwise language distances
)

sample = ['kore1280', 'russ1263', 'stan1290']
evaluator.evaluate_sample(sample, 1)
> Result(run=1, ent_score_with=0.5374082508236077, ent_score_without=0.49544512889359416, fvi_score=0.7686567164179104, mpd_score=0.7836864932465645, fvo_score=0.6302248848665133, sample={'russ1263', 'kore1280', 'stan1290'})
```
